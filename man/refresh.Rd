\usage{
regarima_refresh(
  spec,
  refspec = NULL,
  policy = c("FreeParameters", "Complete", "Outliers_StochasticComponent", "Outliers",
    "FixedParameters", "FixedAutoRegressiveParameters", "Fixed", "Current"),

x13_refresh(
  spec,
  refspec = NULL,
  policy = c("FreeParameters", "Complete", "Outliers_StochasticComponent", "Outliers",
    "FixedParameters", "FixedAutoRegressiveParameters", "Fixed", "Current"),
  period = 0,
  start = NULL,
  end = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spec}{the current specification to be refreshed ("result_spec")}

\item{refspec}{the reference specification used to define the domain considered for re-estimation ("domain_spec")
By default this is the \code{"RG5c"} or \code{"RSA5"} specification.}

\item{policy}{the refresh policy to apply (see details)}

\item{period, start, end}{to specify the span on which outliers will be re-identified when \code{policy} equals to \code{"Outliers"}
or \code{"Outliers_StochasticComponent"}. Span definition: \code{period}: numeric, number of observations in a year (12,4...). \code{start}: vector
indicating the start of the series in the format c(YYYY,MM). \code{end}: vector in the format c(YYYY,MM) indicating the date from which outliers
will be re-identified. If span parameters are not specified outliers will be re-detected on the whole series.}
}
\value{
a new specification, an object of class \code{"JD3_X13_SPEC"} (\code{spec_x13()}),
\code{"JD3_REGARIMA_SPEC"} (\code{spec_regarima()})
}
\description{
Function allowing to create a new specification by updating a specification used for a previous estimation.
Some selected parameters will be kept fixed (previous estimation results) while others will be freed for re-estimation
in a domain of constraints. See details and examples.
}
\details{
The selection of constraints to be kept fixed or re-estimated is called a revision policy.
User-defined parameters are always copied to the new refreshed specifications.
In X-13 only the reg-arima part can be refreshed. X-11 decomposition will be completely re-run,
keeping all the user-defined parameters from the original specification.

Available refresh policies are:

\strong{Current}: applying the current pre-adjustment reg-arima model and adding the new raw data points as Additive Outliers (defined as new intervention variables)

\strong{Fixed}: applying the current pre-adjustment reg-arima model and replacing forecasts by new raw data points.

\strong{FixedParameters}: pre-adjustment reg-arima model is partially modified: regression coefficients will be re-estimated but regression variables, Arima orders
and coefficients are unchanged.
\strong{FixedAutoRegressiveParameters}: same as FixedParameters but Arima Moving Average coefficients (MA) are also re-estimated, Auto-regressive (AR) coefficients are kept fixed.

\strong{FreeParameters}: all regression and Arima model coefficients are re-estimated, regression variables and Arima orders are kept fixed.

\strong{Outliers}: regression variables and Arima orders are kept fixed, but outliers will be re-detected on the defined span, thus all regression and Arima model coefficients are re-estimated

\strong{Outliers_StochasticComponent}: same as "Outliers" but Arima model orders (p,d,q)(P,D,Q) can also be re-identified.
